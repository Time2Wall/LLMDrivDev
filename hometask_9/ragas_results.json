It works as follows:\n\n1. **Forward Pass**: The input data passes through the network, and each neuron computes its output based on the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias term.\n2. **Error Calculation**: A loss function measures how far off the predicted outputs are from the actual targets.\n3. **Backward Pass**: Starting from the output layer, the error is propagated backwards through the network by calculating gradients with respect to each weight and bias in the layers.\n4. **Weight Adjustment**: Using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent or variants (e.g., Adam), these gradients are used to update the weights of the connections between neurons.\n\nThis process helps neural networks learn from their training data, adjusting parameters until they minimize the loss function, effectively improving performance on unseen data.",

      "question": "How do Generative Adversarial Networks work?",
      "answer": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks - a generator and a discriminator that are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process. The generator creates synthetic data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. Through this competition, the generator progressively improves at creating realistic data.",

        "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed for a different but related task. Instead of training from scratch, a pre-trained model's learned features are used as a starting point. In deep learning, this typically involves using a model pre-trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet for vision or large text corpora for NLP) and fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Transfer learning significantly reduces training time and data requirements, making it especially valuable when labeled data is scarce.",
        "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that is adjusted during training. Neural networks learn by processing training examples, adjusting weights through a process called backpropagation to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs."

        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks designed primarily for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers that apply learnable filters to input data, detecting features like edges, textures, and patterns. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important features. The architecture typically consists of alternating convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are neural networks designed for sequential data processing. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form cycles, allowing information to persist across time steps. This makes them suitable for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction. However, standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes learning long-range dependencies difficult. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures address this by using gating mechanisms to control information flow."
