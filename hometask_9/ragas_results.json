        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, receives rewards or penalties, and adjusts its strategy (policy) to maximize cumulative reward. Key concepts include the state space, action space, reward function, and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Popular RL algorithms include Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). RL has been successfully applied to game playing, robotics, and recommendation systems.",
        "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters in the direction of steepest descent. The learning rate controls the step size of each update. Variants include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which uses a single sample per update, mini-batch gradient descent, which uses a subset of samples, and Adam optimizer, which adapts learning rates for each parameter. Gradient descent is the foundation of training neural networks and many other machine learning models.",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are neural networks designed for sequential data processing. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form cycles, allowing information to persist across time steps. This makes them suitable for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and time series prediction. However, standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes learning long-range dependencies difficult. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures address this by using gating mechanisms to control information flow."

      "answer": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — that are trained simultaneously in a competitive process. Through this adversarial training, the generator progressively improves at creating realistic data. A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain.",

        "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed for a different but related task. Instead of training from scratch, a pre-trained model's learned features are used as a starting point. In deep learning, this typically involves using a model pre-trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet for vision or large text corpora for NLP) and fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Transfer learning significantly reduces training time and data requirements, making it especially valuable when labeled data is scarce.",
        "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that is adjusted during training. Neural networks learn by processing training examples, adjusting weights through a process called backpropagation to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs."
